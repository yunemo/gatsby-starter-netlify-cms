## Brand is a tool for growth. 

The purpose of the Francfranc Design System is to enable quick and accurate consensus-building when advocating innovative approaches, reducing the burden on staff and enhancing the value of the brand. The first edition was released in September 2017.

While serving the dual purposes of promoting the brand image and adding functional value in transmitting information, it also aims to efficiently realize a uniformity of quality and encourage the reduction of verification work for staff by producing commonly understood standards.

The Francfranc Design System will help the company evolve and expand while remaining flexible and in tune with changing markets and times. It should be the go-to reference when promoting the origins of the brand or its corporate philosophy.

We hope that staff and other related parties will respect the guidelines, make sound decisions, and produce designs that are both rich in creativity and suitable for the brand.
